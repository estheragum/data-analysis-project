Data Cleaning with Python in Jupyter Notebook

Project Overview
This project showcases my learning and application of data cleaning techniques using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**. The dataset used is real-world and required various preprocessing steps to make it analysis-ready.

Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

What I Did
- Loaded raw data from a `.csv` file
- Identified and handled missing values
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Dropped duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Converted data types and standardized formats
- Exported the cleaned data to a new `.csv` for analysis or visualization

 Files in This Repo
- `data_cleaning.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step cleaning process
- `raw_data.csv` — Original dataset (sample)
- `cleaned_data.csv` — Final output after cleaning

What I Learned
- The importance of proper data preparation
- How to use pandas for efficient data wrangling
- How to document and structure notebooks for clarity

 Next Steps
I plan to:
- Use this cleaned dataset in Power BI or matplotlib/seaborn for visualization
- Expand the notebook into a mini portfolio project
